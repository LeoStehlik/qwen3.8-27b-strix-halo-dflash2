# Qwen3.8 27B + DFlash2 on AMD Strix Halo

A reproducible local deployment of Qwen3.8-27B on a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 / Radeon
8060S, using llama.cpp Vulkan, DFlash2 speculative decoding, vision, a 245,760
token context, exact-request coalescing, a 24 GiB prompt cache, and
on-demand Q4/Q5 model routing.

The service exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint on localhost by default:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
```

Two API model IDs are available:

| API model | Target quant | Intended use |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3.8-27b-q4-fast` | UD-Q4_K_XL | Default, faster agent/chat traffic |
| `qwen3.8-27b-q5-quality` | UD-Q5_K_XL | Quality-sensitive requests |

Both targets share the Q4_K_M DFlash2 drafter and F16 vision projector. The
router keeps one target resident at a time; Q4 loads at startup and Q5 loads on
demand. A streaming front proxy collapses concurrent byte-identical inference
requests into one upstream generation, which avoids duplicate work from client
retries without caching completed responses.

## Measured result

On the reference 128 GB Strix Halo machine, the controlled DFlash width sweep
produced:

| DFlash width | Q4 decode | Q5 decode |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 21.61 tok/s | 18.59 tok/s |
| **4** | **24.87 tok/s** | **20.73 tok/s** |
| 6 | 20.36 tok/s | 17.23 tok/s |

Width 4 is therefore the deployed setting. Short-prompt throughput varies with
the workload and draft acceptance; observed Q4 runs ranged roughly from 23 to
31 tok/s. See [the benchmark record](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) before comparing these
numbers with another system.

A controlled four-client cold-prefill comparison also tested one, two and four
slots. One slot had the best first response (25.1 s), last response (100.9 s)
and aggregate delivered throughput. Two slots delayed the first response to
52.7 s; four delayed it to 102.6 s. Production therefore deliberately queues
independent requests in one slot while coalescing byte-identical concurrent
requests. More admission concurrency was slower on this Vulkan/DFlash2 stack.

Francis's first real OpenClaw trace exposed the more important application
bottleneck. A 152,781-token cold prompt took 9m32s, but the next ten cached
tool-loop turns had a 47.5-second median and eight completed inside one minute.
The server is usable once a session is warm; OpenClaw must reduce and stabilise
its initial prompt to make a new session interactive.

A later OpenCode run demonstrated useful Q5 coding-agent work. One high-reasoning
session produced four merged, CI-green security pull requests addressing eight
alerts. It generated 72,053 tokens across 122 model turns and reached 155,534
context tokens. Weighted decode fell from 21.68 tok/s below 25K context to about
14 tok/s beyond 100K, showing why successful work per hour and context growth
matter more than a short-prompt peak. See the
[OpenCode Q5 case study](docs/OPENCODE-Q5-CASE-STUDY.md).

For agent and tool-calling traffic, the current starting point is:

```json
{
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "top_p": 0.95,
  "top_k": 20,
  "min_p": 0.0,
  "presence_penalty": 0.0,
  "repeat_penalty": 1.0
}
```

Sampling is deliberately set by the client rather than globally by the server.
Thinking is enabled by default, and reasoning is preserved across tool turns.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: x86-64 Linux, a Strix Halo iGPU accessible through `/dev/dri`,
`curl`, `git`, Python 3, the Hugging Face `hf` CLI, and the system Vulkan loader.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LeoStehlik/qwen3.8-27b-strix-halo-dflash2.git
cd qwen38-dflash2

./scripts/download-runtime.sh
./scripts/download-models.sh
./scripts/verify-install.sh
./scripts/install-service.sh
```

Enable user-service startup before login once, if desired:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

Check the service:

```bash
systemctl --user status qwen38-dflash2
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
./smoke-test.py qwen3.8-27b-q4-fast
```

Vision check:

```bash
./make-vision-card.py
./smoke-test.py qwen3.8-27b-q4-fast --image vision-test-card.bmp
```

Full installation and operational details are in [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the reasoning behind the
design and [docs/TUNING.md](docs/TUNING.md) for the remaining experiments.
The separate [ROCm/vLLM investigation](docs/ROCM-VLLM.md) records the planned
AMD MXFP4/DFlash2 comparison without changing the known-good Vulkan service.
