# Handoff for Francis — Flash-Next performance investigation, 2026-11-07

**Performance investigation paused at the user's request for real OpenClaw testing.**
Benchmarks are stopped. The best measured packaged F16 configuration loaded
on private 8083 at 16:08:49 UTC; authenticated access from the Mac mini passed.
OpenClaw PID 369 remains unchanged. The first real user request was observed
at 15,388 prompt tokens, about 1,284 tok/s prefill and 45 tok/s generation
while thinking; this is not a completed agent-quality verdict.
The new 64K control reached **1,416.0 tok/s prefill / 39.3 generation**.
The thinking-enabled benchmark was interrupted; spec-6/spec-8 were not run.
No kernel experiment or tuning-table change is promoted.

The investigation resumed after the user's clean reboot at 14:51:52 UTC.
The original-policy F16 comparison completed: cold 16K **1,074.3 / 40.3 tok/s**,
64K **1,417.5 / 40.9**, and 128K **1,363.2 / 38.9** (prefill/generation).
The first request overlapped GPU queue evictions; long requests were faster.
Rebooting did not eliminate the memory-restore warnings or page migrations.

**Prefill is the first priority, including gains beyond 1,400 tok/s.** The
faster build has been profiled; use that profile to choose further changes. Generation's 50–60 tok/s target
remains active but comes second; tool-call debugging stays parked. Public
probes reached 49.8 tok/s prose, 45.2 on a 16K document, and 57.7 code. These
are workload-dependent results, not a broad 50–60 tok/s baseline.

A reversible `vm.compaction_proactiveness=0` comparison completed with identical
engine configuration: 1,389 / 1,398 / 1,350 tok/s cold prefill at 16K / 64K / 128K.
Its first run reduced eviction after readiness from 4,339 ms to 130 ms, but
a later GDN-arm warm-up paused for seconds with the policy still zero. This
setting alone is NOT a fix; it has been reverted to the original 20.
The 64K prefill profile is complete: routed experts 24.9%, GDN 23.9%,
hyper-connections 20.9%, attention-related work 20.1%. Host grouping is negligible.
The 32K/automatic-cache screen gave 1,375 tok/s but shrank the expert cache to
23,083 slots, so it is not selected. The independent 16K chunked-GDN test gave 1,405 / 1,363 tok/s at 64K / 128K,
within control spread, so it is not selected. The 32K arm with all 24,576 experts
explicitly resident reached 1,393 tok/s with greater memory use; not selected.
The 8K screen reached 1,350 tok/s, also slower. Current best remains the
16K F16 configuration. The narrower 64-row F16 expert-kernel screen reached 1,377 tok/s; not selected.
The chosen 16K configuration completed a 64K / 192K cold check at
1,390.4 / 1,300.9 tok/s prefill and 40.0 / 37.3 generation, with zero presence
penalty and 512 output tokens. Other sampling remained greedy/non-thinking.
Generation tuning follows the prioritized prefill work. The bounded expert
persistent-dispatch experiment is **rejected**: every tested grid was slower
(58.7–85.5 ms versus 54.0–54.3 ms), despite identical outputs and passing routing
checks. [Patch, tests and reproduction](experiments/strata-f16-persistent-dispatch/README.md)
are archived. Residual write/normalization measured 191–195 GB/s against
213–233 GB/s for a simple GPU copy: modest remaining headroom, roughly 1.5%
overall under a simple estimate. The matrix calibration selected solution 2390
for all three large FP16 shapes, already in the packaged table. No kernel or
table change was promoted. Generation comparisons are paused after the control; the user is testing
real traffic before more tuning.

The packaged engine is serving the optimized private-8083 preview for the
user test; loopback benchmarks are stopped. Proactive compaction is back at the original **20**; no persistent
host-policy change remains.
`kernel.numa_balancing` was already zero. Do not call the stall fixed until
the eviction and migration counters support it.

The Tiercel listener at 8083 is loaded and serving user traffic. The Strata service remains
disabled at boot. Its `90-live-preview.conf` runtime override selects the
optimized preview; `90-benchmark.conf` was removed. The old 27B and Qwen3.6 units remain stopped/disabled. No
OpenClaw gateway restart or Mac reboot was performed. Persistent 8083 config
is still the original installer layout; do not enable it blindly. The optimized
preview is selected for live testing; boot promotion remains pending. Read the [performance record](docs/STRATA-PERFORMANCE-2026-11-07.md).

**Flash-Next is connected to the existing `tiercelmoe` provider.** Select
`/model qwen-flash-next`, or the full reference
`tiercelmoe/qwen3.8-flash-next-unsloth-ud-q4_k_xl`.
The Mac mini's authenticated streaming check and Francis's live gateway catalog
passed. OpenClaw applied the provider/alias change through hot reload, with PID
369 unchanged. Subsequent real traffic exposed low throughput and one native
verification watchdog exit/reload. Broader quality validation remains pending.

Read the [connection record and reproducible provider patch](docs/STRATA-OPENCLAW-2026-11-07.md),
[first-load evidence](docs/STRATA-FIRST-LOAD-2026-11-07.md) and
[deployment checklist](docs/STRATA-FLASH-NEXT.md).

**Picker correction:** the initial configured-catalog check did not catch the
old Qwen3.6 references in agent allowlists. At 13:52 UTC those were replaced for
Francis and discord-local, and the new reference added to the default policy.
Both agents' live `models.list` **default/allowed** views now include Flash-Next.
The gateway was not restarted. Reopen an already-sent chat model menu to refresh it.
See the [policy check evidence](evidence/strata-2026-11-07/openclaw-picker-policy.json).

## Current listener and resources

- API for the live preview (loaded, Mac access verified): `http://100.96.8.54:8083/v1`, Tailscale
  address only, existing provider credential required.
- Model: `qwen3.8-flash-next-unsloth-ud-q4_k_xl`.
- Unit: `strata-flash-next.service`, serving the live preview on 8083, disabled at boot. Automatic systemd restart
  after failure remains off. Boot validation for this unit is pending.
- Strata v0.2.11, engine/control 0.1.57, signed HIP-Halo build `0bdcef4682c5+rocm`.
- Context 262,144, INT8 KV, one slot, MTP depth 4, prefill 16,384, GPU vision.
- Route-tail skipping explicitly off; bundled gfx1151 hipBLASLt tuning active.
- Current experimental memory layout: all 24,576 experts / 71.73 GiB in the GPU
  cache, no host expert arena, full GPU KV, own prefill scratch, mmap PLE.
  Model quantization and 262,144 context capacity are unchanged.
- Roughly 17–20 GiB system RAM available during large-context tests.
  GPU driver is live, taint zero, 112 GiB GTT active.

The user explicitly authorized stopping the old 27B server and retaining it.
`qwen38-dflash2.service` is stopped and disabled to prevent resource competition.
Its old `http://100.96.8.54:8080/v1` listener is offline. Its weights, source,
configuration and pre-existing local edits remain intact. To roll back, stop
Flash-Next before enabling/starting the old unit; do not run both together.
Qwen3.6 also remains stopped and disabled, with frozen evidence and files retained.

## Evidence and next work

The direct completion returned exactly `READY`. The synthetic tool check passed
exact typed arguments and tool-result continuation; the continuation reused 540
prompt tokens. A streamed completion from the Mac also passed. Disk checkpoints, streaming
tool calls, an actual image request, above-150K completion
and broader fresh-start reliability remain untested. The upstream historical 1,211 tok/s is not a local
measurement. Do not claim broad agent quality from this smoke check.

The user has tested Flash-Next successfully through Ollama Cloud. Continue with
local performance and real-prompt checks. Only the existing Tiercel provider and
its model alias were changed; agent defaults and current session selections were
not. Do not restart/reboot the Mac or send synthetic agent/channel turns.
The user can select the new alias after the private listener is restored.

Implementation worktree: `/home/less/worktrees/qwen38-strata-20261106`, branch
`investigate/strata-performance-20261107` (branched from deployment commit
`92c5521`). Current local results:
`~/.cache/strata-evaluation-20261107/`; public synthetic evidence:
`evidence/strata-2026-11-07/`. Model data: `~/models/strata-flash-next/`.
Config and engine log: `~/.local/share/strata/flash-next/`.

The [November 6 recovery record](docs/STRATA-RECOVERY-RESULT-2026-11-06.md) and
[pre-reboot incident](docs/STRATA-RECOVERY-2026-11-06.md) are historical.
**Do not repeat the failed live amdgpu reload.** The authorized reboot applied
112 GiB GTT successfully; no additional driver reload or reboot occurred here.

## Deferred dense-model investigation

The cold 64K profile is complete: quantized dense GEMM 62.65% of GPU time,
attention 20.20%. Q5_K and IQ4_XS are the largest dense buckets. Multi-row attention,
F16 staging and fused convolution already exist in this runtime. Draft prefill
is only 0.50%; removing the drafter will not solve prefill.

The earlier next step was a selective dense prefill weight-cache experiment.
That work is deferred for the packaged Flash-Next trial; do not restart it merely
because it appears in the historical handoff. No new dense kernel was applied.
[Full analysis, conditions and ranked experiments](docs/PREFILL-RETURN-2026-11-05.md).

Historical uninstrumented baseline: 367.33 tok/s at cold 64K, one sample. The
new 371.40 tok/s run is instrumented and is not a speedup claim. Preserve the
model/context; judge useful task completion, not isolated throughput alone.

Local raw evidence: `~/.cache/qwen38-return-20261105/`; historical comparison:
`~/.cache/qwen38-ubatch-compare.fp9Hef/`. Public evidence excludes user transcripts.
That profiling work is isolated in `/home/less/worktrees/qwen38-prefill-analysis-20261105` on
`investigate/dense-prefill-20261105`; no source changes or deployment replacement
were made by the profiling investigation. The diagnostic listener is stopped.
